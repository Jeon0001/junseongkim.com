<p>
I am a BSc student in the School of Computing at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), I am also reading Business and Technology Management as a double Major.<br>
<br>
My interests lie in the intersection of data science, ethical technology and business ethics.<br>
<br>
Before joining KAIST, I was based in the United Kingdom where I completed my K-12 education at Magdalen College School, Oxford where I developed a passion for all things STEM.<br>
<br>
In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, competitive swimming, and cooking.<br>
<br>
I am currently working on projects based on benchmarking techniques for analyzing cultural awareness of open-source and proprietary LLMs.<br>

<h1>My Philosophy</h1>

<p>
I believe that technology should be used to improve the lives of all people and that it should be developed in an ethical and sustainable manner.<br>
<br>
I am passionate about using data science to solve the world's most pressing problems and I am always looking for opportunities to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world.<br>
<br>
I am also passionate about business ethics and I believe that businesses should be held to the highest ethical standards.<br>
