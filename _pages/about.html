<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I am a BSc student in the School of Computing at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), I am also reading Business and Technology Management as a double Major.<br>
<br>
My interests lie in the intersection of data science, ethical technology and business ethics.<br>
<br>
Before joining KAIST, I was based in the United Kingdom where I completed my K-12 education at Magdalen College School, Oxford where I developed a passion for all things STEM.<br>
<br>
I am currently working at the Institute for Basic Science as a collaborative data science intern under the <a href="https://www.ibs.re.kr/pag/">Planetary Atmosphere Group</a> and the <a href="https://ds.ibs.re.kr/">Data Science Group</a>.<br>
<br>
My current research focuses on processing data obtained by the <a href="https://akatsuki.isas.jaxa.jp/en/">Akatsuki Venus Orbiter</a> and creating models for anomaly detection to find "Stationary Waves" in Venus' atmosphere.<br>
<br>
In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, competitive swimming, and cooking.<br>
